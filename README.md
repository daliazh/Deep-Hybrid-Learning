# Deep-Hybrid-Learning
A Deep Hybrid Learning Approach For Nail Diseases Classification

To detect nail-based diseases, a Deep Hybrid Learning (DHL) approach was proposed, in which a Deep Learning (DL) model is used for feature extraction and a traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifier is used for classification.

* Reduced training time since ML is used for classification rather than computationally-expensive DL models.
* Auto features extraction using DL.
* sutiable for small-sized datasets.
